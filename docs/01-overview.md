## Components

**intro and one-to-one mapping to usage section**

## Limitations and language coverage

- two enclaves??
- message flow is primarily for json messages over amqp
- divider is not syntax aware

Most of c99 is covered 
- function pointers (might work, not tested) 
- module static functions
- macro generated functions
- any fn called xd can only have arguments be primitives or fixed size arrays of primitives
