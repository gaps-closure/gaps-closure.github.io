abstract = {Privilege separation is an effective technique to improve software security. However, past partitioning systems do not allow programmers to make quantitative tradeoffs between security and performance. In this paper, we describe our toolchain called PM. It can automatically find the optimal boundary in program partitioning. This is achieved by solving an integer-programming model that optimizes for a user-chosen metric while satisfying the remaining security and performance constraints on other metrics. We choose security metrics to reason about how well computed partitions enforce information flow control to: (1) protect the program from low-integrity inputs or (2) prevent leakage of program secrets. As a result, functions in the sensitive module that fall on the optimal partition boundaries automatically identify where declassification is necessary. We used PM to experiment on a set of real-world programs to protect confidentiality and integrity; results show that, with moderate user guidance, PM can find partitions that have better balance between security and performance than partitions found by a previous tool that requires manual declassification.},

abstract = {Partitioning a security-sensitive application into least-privileged components and putting each into a separate protection domain have long been a goal of security practitioners and researchers. However, a stumbling block to automatically partitioning C/C++ applications is the presence of pointers in these applications. Pointers make calculating data dependence, a key step in program partitioning, difficult and hard to scale; furthermore, C/C++ pointers do not carry bounds information, making it impossible to automatically marshall and unmarshall pointer data when they are sent across the boundary of partitions. In this paper, we propose a set of techniques for supporting general pointers in automatic program partitioning. Our system, called PtrSplit, constructs a Program Dependence Graph (PDG) for tracking data and control dependencies in the input program and employs a parameter-tree approach for representing data of pointer types; this approach is modular and avoids global pointer analysis. Furthermore, it performs selective pointer bounds tracking to enable automatic marshalling/unmarshalling of pointer data, even when there is circularity and arbitrary aliasing. As a result, PtrSplit can automatically generate executable partitions for C applications that contain arbitrary pointers.},
