### EoP2 Applications {#eop2}
The EoP2 application is a small application used to illustrate the JAVA CLOSURE capabilities. The application creates a server that  serves frames from a web camera or IP camera to two web pages. Various filters can be applied to these frames using OpenCV to modify the images. The two webpages operate on different enclaves and permit different filters.
