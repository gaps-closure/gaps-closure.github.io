## HAL **XXX: Ta** {#hal}

Partitioned application programs use the HAL API to communicate data through the GAPS Devices.
The detailed documentation for HAL can be found in the C Documentation @CDoc **XXX Rob: add CDoc reference **
This section describes the Java interface to HAL as a reference only, as the actual interaction is hidden from the user and handled by the CodeGenJava-generated code described in the previous section.

### Java XDComms API

AspectJ-woven applications interact with the HAL through the HalZmq class [halzmq](#halzmq). HalZmq provides methods for marshalling/unmarshalling, serialization/de-serialization, and read/write to HAL, abstracting the details from the applications and the cross-domain software developer. 
Code to invoke these methods is auto-generated as part of the CodeGenJava generator portion.
