# Future Work **XXX: Ready for review**

In future work, we will work on relaxing the [known limitations](#limitations).

Also in the research pipeline are:
  
1. diagnostics and refactoring guidance that is friendlier than the output of
the constraint solver
2. support for embedded (non-linux) targets 
3. support for additional languages, in particular, C++ and Java 
4. support for concurrent (multi-threaded) program
5. support for analysis and partitioning of distributed components, namely, the analysis of message flow and program partitioning together
6. Cross domain guard provision-time configuration
