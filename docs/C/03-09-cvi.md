## CVI **XXX: Ben to review plugin content** 
The CLOSURE Visual Interface (CVI) is the editor supporting IDE tools built on top of VSCode to support development of cross-domain applications. The CVI includes i) plugins for syntax highlighting and partitioning diagnostics, ii) Makefiles to invoke CLOSURE toolchain components throughout the workflow, iii) Build Targets making the toolchain "push-button", and iv) integration with the Emulator for end-to-end testing prior to deployment.

### CVI Workflow
During the development lifecylce, the user follows the following CVI steps to build the project:

1. ANNOTATE - plain code (original source) is copied to a ./annotated directory. developer applies annotations to source here

2. ANALYZER PARTITION CONFLICTS - conflict analyzer assesses the annotation for feasibility. upon success a topology is generated

3. AUTOMAGIC - CVI runs through the automated code generation portion including code dividing, gedl, RPC generation, serialization, HAL configuration, and deploy in emulation for test and evaluation.

### Startup and usage

#### Quick start 

Under the `cle-extension` subdirectory under `cvi` repo

```bash
npm install
```

Press `f5` to build and open the extension in a new window. 
A `*.c` or `*.cpp` file must be opened to activate the extension. 

The plugin can be built and installed using `vsce`

```bash
npm install -g vsce
# .vsix generated
vsce package
```

Then you can install the extension in vscode under the extensions window.
There you can click the `...` menu and a dropdown will appear containing `Install from VSIX`.
From there you can give vscode the `.vsix` that was built.

Similarly, the `vsce package` command can be repeated to build the `cle-highlighter` and
`cle-themes` extensions within each of their respective subdirectories in CVI.    

### CLE plugin and language server

The language server is an intermediary between vscode and the conflict analyzer which
handles translating diagnostics from the conflict analyzer into a standardized form defined
by the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

**Diagram from Client --> Language Server --> Conflict Analyzer**    

Since there is no significant coupling between the client and server, 
the language server could be run separately and could be used to supply
diagnostics for different IDEs such as neovim, emacs, eclipse, atom, etc. However, in order
to fully support the CLE plugin, the language client would need to support the `highlight`
and `unhighlight` notifications, which are custom commands to highlight ranges of code with
colors, to visually see the assignments of functions to enclaves.

When in use, the CLE plugin detects CLE syntax and partitioning errors and provides diagnostics to the developer. The feedback may include tips in plain english or minimum set of unstatisfied constraints in MUS MiniZinc form.

### Setting up a new project (Makefiles and VScode tasks)

In order to set up a new project, the developer must customize all these files for their project. 

Use [example1](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1) as a template for setting up a new project. Copy the following subdirectories into your new project folder, maintaining the directory structure found in example1:

- [.make](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make)
    - [closure_env.sh](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/closure_env.sh): enviornment variable settings for the project
    - [conflicts.make](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/conflicts.make): invokes the conflict analyzer during ANALYZE PARTITION CONFLICTS
    - [divvied.make](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/divvied.make): invokes the divider to divide code into separate code-bases by enclave
    - [ect.make](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/ect.make): invokes the program equivalence checker to ensure unpartitioned and partitioned functionality remains unchanged
    - [example.make](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/example.make): the Makefile that builds the application source. This file will be unique for each project and is invoked during BUILD stage
    - [gedl.make](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/gedl.make): invokes the cross-domain cut analysis and produces detailed description of such data types
    - [join.sh](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/join.sh): tool faciliating HAL configuration
    - [mbig.make](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/): supports multi-target compilation and packaging of application
    - [verifier.make](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.make/verifier.make): deprecated, Phase 1 verification
- [.vscode](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.vscode)
    - [tasks.json](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.vscode/tasks.json): includes the definitions and commands associated with the build targets.
    - c_cpp_properties.json, launch.json, settings.json: standard VSCode files
- [.devcontainer](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.devcontainer)
    - [devcontainer.json](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/apps/examples/example1/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json): specifies the CLOSUREDEV container for use (see VSCode remote-containers standard plugin). This file can be customized for more complex projects requiring specific packages.
