## HAL and XDCOMMS API **XXX: Ready for Review**
Partitioned application programs use the HAL API to communicate data through the GAPS Devices, which we call Cross-Domain Guards (CDGs), as well as to configure their control planes. The data-plane client API (currently implemented) is primarily of interest to cross-domain application developers, whereas the control-plane API (to be implemented) will pertain to GAPS device developers. This section describes the HAL architecture, daemon, and user APIs.

### Architecture based on 0MQ 
![HAL interfaces between applications and Network Interfaces.](docs/C/images/hal.png)

The HAL Service runs as a daemon, which can be started manually or started by a systemd script at boot time. The figure shows an example of the HAL daemon supporting multiple applications and CDGs.The figure highlights the three major HAL daemon components:

#### Data Plane Switch
The **Data Plane Switch** forwards packets (containing a tag and ADU) from one interface to another (e.g., from xdd0 to xdd1). Its forwarding in based on the arriving packet's interface name, the packet's [*tag*](#haltag) value, and the HAL configuration file unidirectional mapping rules (**halmap**).  

#### Device Manager
The **Device Manager** opens, configures and manages the different types of interfaces (real or emulated) based on the configuration file's device specification (**devices-spec**):
- Opening the devices specified in the configuration file, using each one's specified addressing/port and communication mode. 
- Reading and writing packets. It waits for received packets on all the opened read interfaces (using a select() function) and transmits packets back out onto the halmap-specified write interface.
  
#### Message Functions {#Message-Functions}
The  **Message Functions** transform and control packets exchanged between the applications and guard devices: 
- *Tag translation* between the internal HAL format and the different CDG packet formats. Each CDG packet format has a separate HAL sub-component that performs the tag encoding and decoding: e.g., [packetize_sdh_bw_v1.c](https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal/blob/develop/daemon/packetize_sdh_bw_v1.c) and [packetize_sdh_bw_v1.h](https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal/blob/develop/daemon/packetize_sdh_bw_v1.h).
- *Message mediation* is not currently supported, but may include functions such as multiplexing/demultiplexing, segmentation/reassembly and rate control.

### HAL Interfaces {#hal-interfaces}

In the figure above, HAL's left interface (xdd0) connects to the applications, while its right interfaces  (e.g., xdd1) connect (through the host's devices) to the CDGs (residing either as a  *bookend* (BE) on the same host as HAL or as a *bump-in-the-wire* (BW).
HAL communicates with the application or guard using its host interfaces, which include: 
- Serial devices carrying TCP/IP packets (e.g., tty0).
- Network devices carrying either UDP or TCP packets (e.g., eth0) in client or server mode).
- ZeroMQ (0MQ) sockets using IPC or INET (e.g., ipc:///tmp/halpub, ipc:///tmp/halsub).

HAL's interface to applications is through the [HAL-API](https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal/blob/develop/api/) *xdcomms C library*,
which currently supports a 0MQ pub/sub interface. The HAL API connects to the two (a publish and a subscribe) HAL listening 0MQ sockets.

### HAL Tag {#haltag}

HAL packets from the application contain only the Application Data Unit (ADU) and a HAL packet header. The packet header contains the HAL tag, with three orthogonal 32-bit unsigned identifiers: *<mux, sec, typ>*, where:
- **mux** is a session multiplexing handle used to identify a unidirectional application flow.
- **sec** identifies a CDG security policy used to processing an ADU. 
- **typ** identifies the type of ADU (based on DFDL xsd definition). This tells HAL how to serialize the ADU. The CDG can also use the tag *typ* (and its associated description) in order to process (e.g., downgrade) the ADU contents.

HAL uses the tag information in the HAL packet header to know how to route data to the correct interface, based on its configuration file mapping (**halmap**) rules.
- When sending data from the applications (on the left side of HAL in the figure above) into the network (on the right side of HAL), HAL [Message Functions](#Message-Functions) will encode (and possibly translate) the **Application tag** into a **Network tag**.
- When receiving data from the network, HAL will decode (and possibly translate) the **Network tag** back into an **Application tag**.

### HAL Daemon Command Options {#HAL-Daemon-Command-Options}

To see the HAL daemon command options, run with the -h option.  Below shows the current options:
```
~/gaps/hal$ daemon/hal -h
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for GAPS CLOSURE project (version 0.11)
Usage: hal [OPTIONS]... CONFIG-FILE
OPTIONS: are one of the following:
 -f : log file name (default = no log file)
 -h : print this message
 -l : log level: 0=TRACE, 1=DEBUG, 2=INFO, 3=WARN, 4=ERROR, 5=FATAL (default = 0)
 -q : quiet: disable logging on stderr (default = enabled)
 -w : device not ready (EAGAIN) wait time in microseconds (default = 1000us): -1 exits if not ready
CONFIG-FILE: path to HAL configuration file (e.g., test/sample.cfg)
```

### HAL Configuration {#HAL-Configuration}

HAL Configuration currently uses a a libconfig file specified when starting the HAL daemon
(see the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide) and the [Install Guide](#halinst)).

The HAL daemon configuration file contains two sections:
- **devices-spec**, which specifies the device configuration for each HAL interface, including:
  - Interface ID (e.g., xdd1), 
  - enable flag,
  - packet format,
  - communication mode,
  - device paths,
  - [optional] addresses and ports,
  - [optional] max packet size (HAL may perform Segment and Reassemble (SAR)),
  - [optional] max rate (bits/second).
- **halmap** routing rules and message functions applied to each allowed unidirectional link.
  - *from_* fields specifying the inbound HAL Interface ID and packet tag values,
  - *to_* fields specifying the outbound HAL Interface ID and packet tag values,
  - message functions specific to this path (e.g., ADU codec).

The [test directory](https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal/tree/develop/test) has examples of configuration files (with a .cfg) extension. Note that, if there are multiple HAL daemon instances on a node (e.g., for testing), then they must be configured with different interfaces.

### Quick Start Guide {#quick-start-guide}
#### Download Sources, Build, and Install {#download-sources-build-and-install}

We have built and tested HAL on a Linux Ubuntu 20.04 system, and while HAL can run on other operating systems / versions, the package installation instructions are for that particular OS and version.

Install the HAL pre-requisite libraries.
```
sudo apt install -y libzmq3-dev
sudo apt install -y libconfig-dev
```
See the [CLOSURE Dev Server Setup](https://github.com/gaps-closure/build/blob/develop/environment_setup.md) for full listing of CLOSURE external dependencies (some of which may be required for HAL on a newly installed system).

Clone the repository, then run make in order to compile HAL, together with its libraries ([API](https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal/tree/develop/api) and [codecs](https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal/tree/develop/appgen)) and test programs:
```
git clone https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal
cd hal
make clean; make
```
Some SDH devices also require installation of a device driver via an associated kernel module. Consult the GAPS Device provider's documentation.

##### Static Binaries #####

To build a static version of you may need the additional packages for the included minimized static build of zmq
```
sudo apt install -y liblzma-dev
sudo apt install -y libunwind-dev
sudo apt install -y libsodium-dev
```

Once you have these dependencies you should simply need to run

```
make clean; make static
```

#### Configure/Run HAL on Target Hardware

An instance of HAL daemon runs on each host or server that directly utilizes the SDH (cross-domain host), and requires a configuration file. If GAPS devices are already configured on enclave hosts in the target environment, we can simply start HAL daemon with the appropriate configuration file in each enclave host:
```
hal$ daemon/hal test/sample_6modemo_b{e|w}_{orange|green}.cfg # e.g. sample_6modemo_be_orange.cfg
```
For this purpose, we have provided sample HAL daemon configuration files that model the Apr '20 demo setup, i.e., green-side and orange-side HAL configurations for either SDH-BE or SDH-BW usage. Note that provided configurations do not mix SDH types for the forward and reverse directions; we will provide these once the hybrid setup becomes available. Also note that contents of the config file may need to be changed depending on the target setup (i.e. SDH-BE device names and SDH-BW end-point IP addresses may differ from those used in current files).

Once the HAL daemon is started, we can run the mission application or a test application such as [halperf](#hal-test-driver-halperfpy) on each enclave.

#### Quick Test of HAL with SDH-BE Loopback or SDH-BW Emulated Network

During development, for testing HAL with SDH-BE loopback drivers or SDH-BW emulated networking, it is possible to run HAL instances for the different enclaves on the same physical machine using their respective configurations. If running this localized setup and if using SDH-BE, the loopback ILIP device driver kernel module `gaps_ilip.ko` must be built and installed using `insmod` before starting HAL. 

```
# Obtain and untar driver source package from SDh-BE developer
cd loopback/ilip
# If using v0.2.0, edit line 426 in ilip_nl.c from #if 0  to  #if 1
vi ilip_nl.c
make clean; make install
insmod gaps_ilip.ko
```

If using SDH-BW, an emulated network (e.g., `test/6MoDemo_BW.net.sh` as shown below) must be configured before starting HAL to instantiate virtual ethernet devices and netcat processes to facilitate the packet movement. The `halperf` test application can then be invoked to send and receive the application traffic workload.

Steps for an end-to-end test for Apr '20 Demo testing on a single host are provided below.

1. Open five terminals (terminal1, terminal2, ... terminal5).
2. Assuming SDH-BW for this example; start the emulated network in terminal3 (skip for SDH-BE):
```
terminal3:
  hal$ cd tests
  hal/tests$: sudo ./6MoDemo_BW.net.sh
```
3. Start HAL (this example assumes SDH-BW) for green and orange enclaves
```
terminal1 (green):
  hal$ daemon/hal test/sample_6modemo_bw_green.cfg

terminal2 (orange):
  hal$ daemon/hal test/sample_6modemo_bw_orange.cfg
```
4. An instance of halperf.py can both send and receive messages. Run an instance on both green and orange enclaves and send the appropriate mux/sec/typ combinations that correspond to the Perspecta tag specification for the Mission App datatypes:
```
terminal4 (green):
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../appgen/6month-demo
  hal/test$ ./halperf.py -s 1 1 1 100 -r 2 2 1 -r 2 2 2 -i ipc:///tmp/halsubbwgreen -o ipc:///tmp/halpubbwgreen

terminal5 (orange):
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../appgen/6month-demo
  hal/test$ ./halperf.py -s 2 2 1 10 -s 2 2 2 100 -r 1 1 1 -i ipc:///tmp/halsubbworange -o ipc:///tmp/halpubbworange
  ```
Note the -i and -o arguments which correspond to input/ouptut ZMQ interfaces utilized by HAL. The example provided is for SDH-BW. If using SDH-BE, replace 'bw' with 'be' for each -i and -o argument (e.g. halpub<b>bw</b>orange --> halpub<b>be</b>orange)

The sending rates in the above calls are 1 Hz for simplicity. (For the representative mission application rates, you can send 1,1,1 at 100Hz, 2,2,1 at 10Hz, and 2,2,2 at 100Hz instead. Other rates and application mixes can be used for stress-testing or for testing policy rules.) Example output:
```
terminal4 (green):
sent: [1/1/1] -- (-74.574489,40.695545,102.100000)
recv: [2/2/2] -- (-1.021000,2.334000,0.900000)
recv: [2/2/1] -- (-74.574489,40.695545,102.400000)

terminal5 (orange):
recv: [1/1/1] -- (-74.574489,40.695545,102.100000)
sent: [2/2/2] -- (-1.021000,2.334000,0.900000)
sent: [2/2/1] -- (-74.574489,40.695545,102.400000)
```

#### Cleanup of HAL Components
Ctrl-C can be used to kill most processes. Additional cleanup scripts are provided if needed:
```
hal/test$ ./kill_my_hall.sh f
hal/test$ sudo pkill -f "nc -klu"
hal/test$ sudo pkill -f "nc -u"
```

### HAL Installation and Usage {#halinst}

#### Build HAL

See [Download Sources, Build, and Install](#download-sources-build-and-install) for required steps.

#### Run HAL
Starting the HAL daemon requires specifying a HAL configuration file and any [options](#HAL-Daemon-Command-Options). The [test directory](https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal/tree/develop/test) has examples of configuration files (with a .cfg) extension. 

##### HAL Loopback Mode
At its simplest, we can start HAL to echo send requests made back on the application interface. Loopback mode is enabled by specifying the loopback configuration file [test/config_simple_exampes/sample_loopback.cfg](https://github.com/gaps-closure/hal/blob/develop/test/config_simple_examples/sample_loopback.cfg)

```
cd hal
hal$ daemon/hal test/config_simple_examples/sample_loopback.cfg
```
In this case, HAL receives packets on its application read interface and routes them back to its application write interface. This requires no network devices (or network access).

Below is an example of the output from the HAL daemon, showing the configuratin of the :
- Single device called *xdd0*, using a pub/sub ipc connection (using connection mode sdh_ha_v1), with file descriptors 3 and 6 for reading and writing.
- A single HAL map (*halmap*) routing entry, which forwards application data from the application *xdd0* device with a HAL tag *<mux, sec, typ> = <1,1,1>* back to the application *xdd0* device. It also translates that tag to *<mux, sec, typ> = <1,2309737967,1>*
```
hal$ daemon/hal test/sample_loopback.cfg 
HAL device list:
 xdd0 [v=1 d=./zc/zc m=sdh_ha_v1 c=ipc mi=sub mo=pub fr=3 fw=6]
HAL map list (0x5597a6af8150):
 xdd0 [mux=01 sec=01 typ=01] ->  xdd0 [mux=01 sec=2309737967 typ=01] , codec=NULL

HAL Waiting for input on fds, 3
```
##### HAL Test Driver (halperf.py) {#hal-test-driver-halperfpy}
We provide an easy to use utility, <b>halperf.py</b>, for sending and receiving Mission App datatypes (Position/Distance) while utilizing HAL and SDH. halperf constructs an in-memory instance of the datatype, provides it to HAL with appropriate application [tag](#haltag), HAL maps it to the configured SDH, constructs the on-wire format, and releases a frame to the SDH. The receive-side HAL unrolls the frame and provides it to the receiving halperf instance.
```
usage: halperf.py [-h] [-s MUX SEC TYP RATE] [-r MUX SEC TYP] [-l PATH]
                  [-x PATH] [-i URI] [-o URI]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s MUX SEC TYP RATE, --send MUX SEC TYP RATE
                        send cross-domain flow using MUX/SEC/TYP at RATE (Hz)
  -r MUX SEC TYP, --recv MUX SEC TYP
                        recv cross-domain flow mapped to MUX/SEC/TYP
  -l PATH               path to mission app shared libraries
                        (default=../appgen/6month-demo)
  -x PATH               path to libxdcomms.so (default=../api)
  -i URI                in URI (default=ipc:///tmp/halpub1)
  -o URI                out URI (default=ipc:///tmp/halsub1)

```

The [HAL daemon configuration](#halconfig) uses a libconfig File, which contains HAL maps (routes) and Device configurations. 

### XDCOMMS API
Applications interact with the HAL through an [API](#xdcommsapi). The API simplifies read/write to HAL, abstracting the details from the applications and the cross-domain software developer. API code is auto-generated as part of the RPC generator portion of Automagic build step.
