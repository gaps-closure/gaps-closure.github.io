## Autogenerated Data Format Definition Language (DFDL) Schemas

CLOSURE generates DFDL schema specifications for the serialized cross-domain data
items (RPC requests and responses) along with the GAPS header and trailer fields
for the bump-in-the-wire (MIND) and bookend (ILIP) GAPS devices.

** include DFDL for sample.idl for BW and BE **
