## IDL {#idl-appendix}

The IDL syntax is based on C; an IDL file contains one or more C struct datatypes. See sample.idl for an example.

Datatype tags are assigned numerically in the order the structs are found in the file. Not all valid C struct declarations are supported.

Currently we support the following atomic types: char (8b), unsigned char (8b), short (16b), unsigned short (16b), int (32b), unsigned int (32b), long (64b), unsigned long (64b), float (4B), double (8B). We also support fixed-size arrays of any supported atomic type.

Support for null-terminated C-strings, and C++ datatypes such as std::string, std::array, and std::vector is future work.
