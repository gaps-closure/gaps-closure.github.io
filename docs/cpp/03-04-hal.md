## Interfacing with HAL [TODO: TA] {#hal}

XXX: Replace with a C++ relevant discussion based on your examples.



With the CLOSURE C toolchain @CDoc, partitioned application programs use the xdcomms API library 
to interface with the HAL daemon which exchanges data through the GAPS Devices.

In the Java toolchain, there is no separate xdcomms API library, and the
interaction with the HAL daemon is handled by the code generated by the
CodeGenJava tool described in the previous section. AspectJ-woven applications 
interact with the HAL through the HalZmq class [halzmq](#halzmq). HalZmq 
provides methods for marshaling/unmarshalling, serialization/de-serialization, 
and read/write to HAL, abstracting the details from the applications and the 
cross-domain software developer. The autogenerated code invokes methods
provided by the HalZmq class.

The following flow diagram shows the steps taken from the method invocation
intercepted by Aspect pointcut in one enclave to the point in another enclave
where the actual method is invoked.
